# Medical Cost Prediction using Machine Learning Models

This project aims to predict individual medical insurance costs based on personal and health-related information using various machine learning models. The dataset used is the popular `insurance.csv`, which contains features like age, BMI, smoker status, and region.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [insurance.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance)
- **Total Records**: 1338
- **Features**:
  - `age`: Age of the individual
  - `sex`: Gender
  - `bmi`: Body Mass Index
  - `children`: Number of children covered by insurance
  - `smoker`: Smoking status
  - `region`: Residential region
  - `expenses`: Medical insurance charges (Target)

---

## Objective

To build a regression model that accurately predicts `expenses` based on input features, and deploy the solution using **Streamlit** for interactive user predictions.
